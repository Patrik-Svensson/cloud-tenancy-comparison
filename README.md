# Cloud Tenancy Comparison

## Background
Cloud applications are essential in todayâ€™s digital landscape, making it crucial to choose the right architecture for scalability, performance, and cost efficiency. This project compares three common cloud tenancy models:

- **Single-Tenant App**
- **Multi-Tenant App**
- **Multi-Tenant Sharded App**

The goal of this project is to measure and compare the performance of these three cloud app architectures. By running load tests on each architecture, we aim to understand how each model performs under different conditions and scale.

The apps used in this comparison are based on the **Contoso University** app from Microsoft.

## Tools and Environment
- **Visual Studio**
